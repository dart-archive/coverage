  from `runAndCollect` and the `Resolver` constructor.

## 0.14.2 - 2020-11-10

  depending on the comments.

  Use // coverage:ignore-line to ignore one line.

  Use // coverage:ignore-file to ignore the whole file.

## 0.13.5 - 2020-01-30

* Update `parseChromeCoverage` to merge coverage information for a given line.
* Handle source map parse errors in `parseChromeCoverage`. Coverage will not be
  considered for Dart files that have corresponding invalid source maps.

## 0.13.4 - 2020-01-23

* Add `parseChromeCoverage` for creating a Dart based coverage report from a
  Chrome coverage report.

## 0.13.3+3 - 2019-12-03

* Re-loosen the dependency on the `vm_service` package from `>=1.0.0 < 2.1.2`
  to `>=1.0.0 <3.0.0` now that breakage introduced in version `2.1.2` has been
  resolved. Fixed in:
  https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/7a911ce3f1e945f2cbd1967c6109127e3acbab5a.

## 0.13.3+2 - 2019-12-02

* Tighten the dependency on the `vm_service` package from `>=1.0.0 <3.0.0` down
  to `>=1.0.0 <2.1.2` in order to exclude version `2.1.2` which is broken on
  the current stable Dart VM due to a missing SDK constraint in its pubspec.yaml.
  The breakage was introduced in: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/9e636b5ab4de850fb19bc262e0686fdf14bfbfc0.

## 0.13.3+1 - 2019-10-10

* Loosen the dependency on the `vm_service` package from `^1.0.0` to `>=1.0.0
  <3.0.0`. Ensures dependency version range compatibility with the latest
  versions of package `test`.

## 0.13.3 - 2019-09-27

 * Adds a new named argument to `collect` to filter coverage results by a set
   of VM isolate IDs.
 * Migrates implementation of VM service protocol library from
   `package:vm_service_lib`, which is no longer maintained, to
   `package:vm_service`, which is.

## 0.13.2 - 2019-07-18

 * Add new multi-flag option `--scope-output` which restricts coverage output
   so that only scripts that start with the provided path are considered.

## 0.13.1 - 2019-07-18

 * Handle scenario where the VM returns empty coverage information for a range.

## 0.13.0 - 2019-07-10

 * BREAKING CHANGE: Skips collecting coverage for `dart:` libraries by default,
   which provides a significant performance boost. To restore the previous
   behaviour and collect coverage for these libraries, use the `--include-dart`
   flag.
 * Disables WebSocket compression for coverage collection. Since almost all
   coverage collection runs happen over the loopback interface to localhost,
   this improves performance and reduces CPU usage.
 * Migrates implementation of VM service protocol library from
   `package:vm_service_client`, which is no longer maintained, to
   `package:vm_service_lib`, which is.

## 0.12.4 - 2019-01-11

 * `collect()` now immediately throws `ArgumentError` if a null URI is passed
   in the `serviceUri` parameter to avoid a less-easily debuggable null
   dereference later. See dart-lang/coverage#240 for details.

## 0.12.3 - 2018-10-19

 * Fixed dart-lang/coverage#194. During collection, we now track each script by
   its (unique) VMScriptRef. This ensures we look up the correct script when
   computing the affected line for each hit token. The hitmap remains URI
   based, since in the end, we want a single, unified set of line to hitCount
   mappings per script.

## 0.12.2 - 2018-07-25

 * Dart SDK upper bound raised to <3.0.0.

## 0.12.1 - 2018-06-26

 * Minor type, dartfmt fixes.
 * Require package:args >= 1.4.0.

## 0.12.0 - 2018-06-26

 * BREAKING CHANGE: This version requires Dart SDK 2.0.0-dev.64.1 or later.
 * Strong mode fixes as of Dart SDK 2.0.0-dev.64.1.

## 0.11.0 - 2018-04-12

 * BREAKING CHANGE: This version requires Dart SDK 2.0.0-dev.30 or later.
 * Updated to Dart 2.0 constants from dart:convert.

## 0.10.0 - 2017-12-14

 * BREAKING CHANGE: `createHitmap` and `mergeHitmaps` now specify generic types
   (`Map<String, Map<int, int>>`) on their hit map parameter/return value.
 * Updated package:args dependency to 1.0.0.

## 0.9.3 - 2017-10-02

 * Strong mode fixes as of Dart SDK 1.24.0.
 * Restrict the SDK lower version constraint to `>=1.21.0`. Required for method
   generics.
 * Eliminate dependency on package:async.

## 0.9.2 - 2017-02-03

 * Strong mode fixes as of Dart SDK 1.22.0.

## 0.9.1 - 2017-01-18

 * Temporarily add back support for the `--host` and `--port` options to
   `collect_coverage`. This is a temporary measure for backwards-compatibility
   that may stop working on Dart SDKs >= 1.22. See the related
   [breaking change note](https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!msg/announce/VxSw-V5tx8k/wPV0GfX7BwAJ)
   for the Dart VM service protocol.

## 0.9.0 - 2017-01-11

 * BREAKING CHANGE: `collect` no longer supports the `host` and `port`
   parameters. These are replaced with a `serviceUri` parameter. As of Dart SDK
   1.22, the Dart VM will emit Observatory URIs that include an authentication
   token for security reasons. Automated tools will need to scrape stdout for
   this URI and pass it to `collect_coverage`.
 * BREAKING CHANGE: `collect_coverage`: the `--host` and `--port` options have
   been replaced with a `--uri` option. See the above change for details.
 * BREAKING CHANGE: `runAndCollect` now defaults to running in checked mode.
 * Added `extractObservatoryUri`: scrapes an input string for an Observatory
   URI. Potentially useful for automated tooling after Dart SDK 1.22.

## 0.8.1

 * Added optional `checked` parameter to `runAndCollect` to run in checked
   mode.

## 0.8.0+2

 * Strong mode fixes as of Dart SDK 1.20.1.

## 0.8.0+1

 * Make strong mode clean.

## 0.8.0

 * Moved `Formatter.format` parameters `reportOn` and `basePath` to
   constructor. Eliminated `pathFilter` parameter.

## 0.7.9

 * `format_coverage`: add `--base-directory` option. Source paths in
   LCOV/pretty-print output are relative to this directory, or absolute if
   unspecified.

## 0.7.8

 * `format_coverage`: support `--packages` option for package specs.

## 0.7.7

 * Add fallback URI resolution for Bazel http(s) URIs that don't contain a
   `packages` path component.

## 0.7.6

 * Add [Bazel](http://bazel.io) support to `format_coverage`.

## 0.7.5

 * Bugfix in `collect_coverage`: prevent hang if initial VM service connection
   is slow.
 * Workaround for VM behaviour in which `evaluate:source` ranges may appear in
   the returned source report manifesting in a crash in `collect_coverage`.
   These generally correspond to source evaluations in the debugger and add
   little value to line coverage.
 * `format_coverage`: may be slower for large sets of coverage JSON input
   files. Unlikely to be an issue due to elimination of `--coverage-dir` VM
   flag.

## 0.7.4

 * Require at least Dart SDK 1.16.0.

 * Bugfix in format_coverage: if `--report-on` is not specified, emit all
   coverage, rather than none.

## 0.7.3

 * Added support for the latest Dart SDK.

## 0.7.2

 * `Formatter.format` added two optional arguments: `reportOn` and `pathFilter`.
   They can be used independently to limit the files which are included in the
   output.

 * Added `runAndCollect` API to library.

## 0.7.1

 * Added `collect` top-level method.

 * Updated support for latest `0.11.0` dev build.

 * Replaced `ServiceEvent.eventType` with `ServiceEvent.kind`.
   *  `ServiceEvent.eventType` is deprecated and will be removed in `0.8`.

## 0.7.0

 * `format_coverage` no longer emits SDK coverage unless --sdk-root is set
   explicitly.

 * Removed support for collecting coverage from old (<1.9.0) Dart SDKs.

 * Removed deprecated `Resolver.pkgRoot`.

## 0.6.5

 * Fixed early collection bug when --wait-paused is set.

## 0.6.4

 * Optimized formatters and fixed return value of `format` methods.

 * Added `Resolver.packageRoot` – deprecated `Resolver.pkgRoot`.

## 0.6.3

 * Support the latest release of `args` package.

 * Support the latest release of `logging` package.

 * Fixed error when trying to access invalid paths.

 * Require at least Dart SDK v1.9.0.

## 0.6.2
 * Support observatory protocol changes for VM >= 1.11.0.

## 0.6.1
 * Support observatory protocol changes for VM >= 1.10.0.

## 0.6.0+1
 * Add support for `pub global run`.

## 0.6.0
  * Add support for SDK versions >= 1.9.0. For Dartium/content-shell versions
    past 1.9.0, coverage collection is no longer done over the remote debugging
    port, but via the observatory port emitted on stdout. Backward
    compatibility with SDKs back to 1.5.x is provided.
