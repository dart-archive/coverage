0.6.0+1
   * Add support for `pub global run`

0.6.0
   * Add support for SDK versions >= 1.9.0. For Dartium/content-shell versions
     past 1.9.0, coverage collection is no longer done over the remote debugging
     port, but via the observatory port emitted on stdout. Backward
     compatibility with SDKs back to 1.5.x is provided.
